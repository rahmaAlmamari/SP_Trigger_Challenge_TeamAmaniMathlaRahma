# **Stored Procedure** 

## What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a group of prepared SQL code that you can save, 
so the code can be reused over and over again by simply calling it whenever needed.

It can be used to perform a wide range of database operations 
such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, generating reports, 
and performing complex calculations. Stored procedures are very useful 
because they allow you to encapsulate (bundle) a set of SQL statements as 
a single unit and execute them repeatedly with different parameters, 
making it easy to manage and reuse the code.
