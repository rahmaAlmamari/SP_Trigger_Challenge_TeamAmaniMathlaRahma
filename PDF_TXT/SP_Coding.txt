- How to Create a Simple Stored Procedure in SQL?

1. The basic syntax to create an SQL stored procedure is as follows:

1.1. Creation Syntax
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...)
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements to be executed
END
DELIMITER ;
```

NOTE: 
- The CREATE PROCEDURE statement is used to create the procedure. We can define any number of input parameters as per the requirement.
- The SQL statements that make up the procedure are placed between the BEGIN and END keywords.

1.2. Execution Syntax

```sql
EXEC procedure_name;
```
